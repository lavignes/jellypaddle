Jelly Paddle

Compile using the makefile. Using the 'make play' target will run
with vsync forced off. Run 'jellypaddle' to start the game.

Controls:
  Left arrow  => float left
  Right arrow => float right
  Up arrow    => float up
  Down arrow  => float down

Description:
  Break all the bricks to see your score for that round.
  Every time line of bricks is cleared the game gets harder.
  There is no penalty for losing the ball. Sometimes you want
  it to go offscreen. If the ball leaves the playfield, slam
  the paddle forcefully against the last wall the ball touched.
  That *should* reset the ball.

Why its cool:
  You'll know. It's also evidently implemented as a simple game engine,
  everything that makes it breakout is in brkout.c

Challenges:
  None really, it seems complex, but the math is actually super simple.
  I wrote most of it in one night. So forgive the glitchiness.
